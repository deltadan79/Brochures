                        <h1>The Bible—What Is Its Message?</h1>
                        <p>
Designed to appeal to those who know little about the Bible, especially those in non-Christian religions
How to offer it: “We would like to get your opinion on what is stated here in the Scriptures (or in this holy book). [Read Psalm 37:11, which is referred to in section 11.] What do you think the earth will be like when this prophecy is fulfilled? [Allow for response.] This is an example of the hope and comfort that people of all cultures and faiths can receive from the Bible.” Read the paragraph at the top of page 3, and offer the brochure.
You might try this: If you are conducting a Bible study in the Bible Teach book with a person from a non-Christian religion, take a few minutes at the beginning or end of each study to consider one section of this brochure to give him an overview of the Bible.

                        <h2>A Book for All People</h2>
                        <p>
Designed to appeal to educated people who know little about the Bible
How to offer it: Read 2 Timothy 3:16, 17. Then say: “Do you agree with this, that the Bible is inspired of God? Or do you think that it is simply a good book? [Allow for response.] Most people have an opinion on this question, but we have found that few have actually examined the Bible for themselves. [Read the experience under the title on page 3.] This interesting brochure outlines good reasons for people of all backgrounds and faiths to consider what the Bible contains.”
You might try this: If the householder accepts the brochure, say: “One reason that many people think the Bible has little to offer is because religion has misrepresented the Bible and its teachings. When I come back, I’d like to give you an example.” When you return, consider some of the information from pages 4-5.

                        <h2>The Origin of Life—Five Questions Worth Asking</h2>
                        <p>
Designed for Christian youths who are being taught evolution in school and is also helpful when reasoning with evolutionists, agnostics, and atheists (This brochure is not designed to be offered from house-to-house.)
How to use it when speaking to an evolutionist or an atheist: “Virtually all science textbooks today teach evolution. Do you believe that evolution is a theory, or do you think that it has now been established as fact? [Allow for response.] To make an informed decision, I’m sure you will agree that we should examine both sides of a matter. This brochure presents some of the evidence that has led many to believe that life was created.”
You might try this: If you go to school, leave the brochure out on your desk and see if it piques the curiosity of any classmates.
